            <header class="major"><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
            <p>This year's data science week was a very fun learning experience, since I got to improve my data analysis 
                and wrangling skills. The datathon was my first hands-on data science project with the goal of trying to 
                predict real estate prices through linear regression and gradient boosting. I partnered up with Elvin 
                Khoirunnisa, a master student from Business IT and we managed to land on the third place of this competition.</p>

            <header class="major"><h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2></header>
            <p>This dataset had 81 columns, so a lot of variables to consider. First we looked into the data types and found 
                43 strings, 35 integer and 3 float columns. Then, we took a brief look at missing values of the data, to get
                 an overview. By analyzing the distribution and correlation of numerical variables, we made a correlation 
                 matrix with the most important numerical variables to understand the key drivers of the sale price. </p>

            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/corr_matrix.png" alt="" /></span>

            <header class="major"><h2>Data Wrangling</h2></header>
            <p>All the steps on the train set were also applied on the test data set.</p>
            <h3>Handling Mising Values</h3></header>
            <p>We noticed that there are 3 numerical columns with missing values, namely MasVnrArea, GarageYrBlt, LotFrontage. 
                In order to find an appropriate statistic to fill in all nan values, we plotted the distribution of them. We 
                decided to take the median for LotFrontage and MasVnrArea and the mode for GarageYrBlt.</p>
            
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/num_missing.png" alt="" /></span>
           
            <p>For categorical variables, we replaced the nan values with their actual information. For example houses that do not 
                have a garage, have missing values in those columns. In that case, we imputed the nan value with 'No garage'.</p> 

            <h3>Numerical Feature Selection</h3></header>


            <p>Each numerical variable was assessed and there were four ways on how to deal with them. Some of the numerical 
                variables had outliers, which we removed, in order to improve the performance of the model. Some were falsely 
                classified as integers, so we converted them to string, others had so many '0', so we decided to drop these columns. 
                There were of course also numerical variables, which were totally fine. </p>

                <div class="col-4 col-12-medium">

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Log Transformation</h3></header>
            <p>There was the idea to apply log transformation on some of the variables, because some numerical features were 
                suitable for that. In that week, we did not have time to do this, so this will be something for a later point in time. </p>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/LogTransformation.png" alt="" /></span>

            <header class="major"><h2>Model Building and Accuracy</h2></header>
            <p>First we declared the dependent and independent variables of the training set. Afterwards, the inputs of the training 
                and test data set were concatenated to generate the dummy variables and standardize all features. We then splitted the 
                training set into train and validation data with their respective inputs and target values. As a machine learning model, 
                we took linear regression with gradient boost, a model that consists of many weak learners that make its predictive 
                power very high. </p>

            <p>Train RMSE: 18502<br>
                Test RMSE: 22332</p>
            <p>Train R-squared:  0.924<br>
                Test R-squared:  0.889</p>
            <p>Train adjusted R-squared: 0.92<br>
                Test adjusted R-squared: 0.9</p><br>

            <header class="major"><h2>Conclusions</h2></header>
            <p>At first we were very confident with our machine learning model, because it had a r-squared value of 0.889 on the validation set. 
                When the results of others were published, we had a much lower r-squared and higher RMSE than expected. The reason for this is that 
                there were some variables in the test set that were not taken into account by the ML model. We falsely assumed that the validation set 
                has the same set of values for each variable as the train and test set.</p>
            <p>To make things easier, we should have concatenated the train and test set before we started preprocessing, applying log transformation and 
                aggregating values to a higher level to achieve more accurate results.</p>
            <p>All in all, the data science week was a lot of fun and it gave me the first chance to get in touch and try out machine learning models. 
                It was very interesting to find an ideal balance between under- and overfitting of the model and learning about different requirements 
                for ML models when it comes down to its purpose (Datathon, Research, Industry application).</p>
