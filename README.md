# [Project 2: Snake On Steroids (Java)](https://github.com/yasinfahmy/Snake-On-Steroids)
This is a program about the well known snake game. The only difference is, that there is always a chance of a golden apple spawning. When eating it, the snake becomes immortal and can not collide with itself nor the borders.
- Implemented a new feature with golden apples that makes the snake invulnerable
- Implemented timers for the "color effect" and invulnerability
- Made it possible to restart the game in the end screen
