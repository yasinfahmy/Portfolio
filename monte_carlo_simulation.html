            <header class="major"><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
            <p>This tool was part of the research project of the Finance for Engineers module of the Business IT Bachelor programm. 
                Additionally to this tool I developed, my teammates developed a simulation tool for a stock portfolio and discussed our 
                research question of <i>“To what extent does a Monte Carlo Simulation help financial analysts assess possible portfolio and 
                stock returns?”</i> in further detail. For more information about the report or the tools, please have a look in the 
                Finance-For-Engineers repository on GitHub.</p>

            <p>Monte Carlo Simulation is a technique to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event. Based on the distribution of 
                historical data, multiple simulations are run, which provide different outcomes of a future event. The probability of different 
                outcomes is simulated, that can not be predicted due to the randomness of variables. In practice, the simulation assigns a random 
                value to the variable that has uncertainty. Lastly, simulations can be run repeatedly to make up a representative sample of the 
                infinite number of possible combinations.</p>

            <header class="major"><h2>Mathematical Background</h2></header> 
            <p>It is assumed that stock prices follow a random walk and that the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis is true, meaning that 
                future returns are independent of past ones. The stochastic process of stock price development is memoryless, which is referred to as the Markov property.</p>
            <span class="image right"><img src="images/Monte Carlo/price.JPG" alt="" /></span>
            <p>The price of today is the price of yesterday times its daily return. Since log returns are used for the simulation, to get the real return, it is needed to 
                calculate e to the power of the logarithmic return.</p>
            <span class="image right"><img src="images/Monte Carlo/drift.JPG" alt="" /></span>
            <p>Yesterday's stock price is known, but r is a random variable. The movement of a random variable that follows a Markov Stochastic Process can be described as 
                the Wiener's Process or Brownian Motion. It allows us to model that randomness. It consists of the addition of two components, the drift (approximation of 
                future expected daily return of stock) and stock's volatility (shock).</p>
            <span class="image right"><img src="images/Monte Carlo/shock.JPG" alt="" /></span>
            <p>Z corresponds to the distance between the data point and its mean within a standard normal distribution (Number of standard deviations), also referred to as 
                the standard Brownian motion.</p>
            <span class="image right"><img src="images/Monte Carlo/final_price.JPG" alt="" /></span>
            <p>Based on the geometric Brownian motion, today's price will be:</p>

            <header class="major"><h2>Algorithm Explanation</h2></header>
            <P>After importing all the necessary libraries, the historical adjusted stock price data is fetched from yahoo.finance. After that, 
                the data is transformed into logarithmic daily returns. Based on that, the mean and variance are calculated in order to determine 
                the drift component. </P>
            <p>To calculate the shock component, the standard deviation of the log returns is computed and multiplied with a data frame consisting 
                of Z-values based on a random probability. The number of rows and columns in the data frame correspond to the number of days to 
                simulate and iterations of the simulation, respectively. In order to get the actual daily returns, the log returns are converted back 
                into arithmetic values, by taking all the values to the exponent of e (Euler's number).</p>                              
            <p>A new data frame, with the same size is created, to simulate the prices. First, the first row is filled with the most recent stock price 
                available. With the help of a loop the next price is calculated by multiplying the last price with the simulated daily return.</p>
            <p>To showcase the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval with 95% certainty, the returns were calculated in a similar way as for 
                the simulations, but the shock component was not random this time. Instead the standard deviation was multiplied by +/- 1.96 to achieve 
                the upper and lower bounds. For the expected return, each price is calculated by multiplying the precedent price point with the mean return.</p>

            <header class="major"><h2>Limitations and Assumptions</h2></header>
            <p>Explaining the past is much easier than predicting the future. As briefly mentioned in the research question discussion, in spite of the confidence
                 interval that was applied in the tool, the Monte Carlo simulation has limitations that can affect the accuracy of the results. These drawbacks 
                 concern the fact that the simulation only considers past price data and does not take into account macro economical scenarios or black swan events. 
                 When considering only price data, plenty of additional important variables which directly affect the stock price or portfolio are naturally ignored, 
                 which may result in inaccurate estimations. </p>

            <p>The simulation does not consider macro economical scenarios such as inflation, unemployment rate and industrial output which may correlate with the stock 
                price. As for the confidence interval itself, It also has drawbacks, as the confidence interval will only be valid if the market will stay the same in the 
                upcoming period, as it was during the time which the data was taken. For example, in case the data has been taken last year but in the upcoming future a 
                recession will take place, the volatility will be higher for every stock (VIX index) than it was at the time that the data was taken, hence affecting the 
                accuracy of prediction.</p> 

            <p>Moreover, if the stock has experienced massive growth over the period, the data was fetched from, the simulation will assume steady growth for that stock 
                and reflect unrealistic future scenarios. Therefore it is important to feed the algorithm a lot of data, from a long period, to account for this. For the 
                simulation of Tesla for example, sometimes the simulated stock developments were so extreme that Tesla's stock would reach a stock price of thousands of 
                dollars after a 1000 days period (current stock price: 225$, 27.10.2022). That is because Tesla has experienced extreme stock price growth since 2020. </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>In theory, a Monte Carlo simulation is able to incorporate autocorrelations like inflation and non-normal stock returns, but the constraints are most often 
                set by the creator of a Monte Carlo simulation tool, often due to missing or inaccurate data sources. If one decides to still take those factors into account, 
                it is recommended to do that with proper care and choose high quality inputs, because the principle of “garbage in, garbage out” also applies in this case. </p>
